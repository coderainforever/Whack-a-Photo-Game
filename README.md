üî® Whack-a-Photo: The Personalized Whack-a-Mole Game

Whack-a-Photo is a fun, single-file JavaScript game that puts a custom, modern twist on the classic arcade game, Whack-a-Mole. Instead of whacking a cartoon mole, players upload a photo of their choice (friend, pet, celebrity) to appear in the holes!

‚ú® Features

Personalized Target: Upload any image file (.png, .jpg, etc.) to use as the target in the game.

Classic Gameplay: Race against a 30-second timer to score as many hits as possible.

Custom Hammer Cursor: The default cursor is replaced with a üî® hammer emoji for an immersive whacking experience.

Visual Feedback: Moles flash red and disappear instantly when successfully whacked.

Fully Contained: The entire game is built into a single, dependency-free HTML file.

Responsive Design: Optimized for play on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Open the Game: Simply open the whack_a_photo.html file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

Upload a Photo (Optional): Click the "Upload Photo for Whacking" file input and select an image from your device. If you skip this step, a default üë§ emoji will be used.

Start the Timer: Click the START GAME button.

Whack Away: Use your hammer cursor (mouse or touch) to click the photo/emoji every time it pops out of a hole.

Score & End: The game ends after 30 seconds, and your final score will be displayed.
